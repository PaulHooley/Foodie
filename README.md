TODO:
- [ ] Dislikes 
- [x] Ingredients.txt has preferences 2 times 
- [x] IngredientsWeekly.txt is missing tags
- [ ] If preferences and dislikes are the same it should ignore updating ingredients.txt
    - Unless we update ingredientsMaster.txt, need some thought for this - might omit this
- [x] No duplicate weekly meals (Remove extra "Tag" lines in ingredientsWeekly)
- [x] NullPointer from ingredients.txt reaching the end
- [x] Finish shopping cart
- [ ] Manually change all values in Master.txt so that they will stack better (PIA)
